            <h2>The Perspective</h2>
            <p>
                Once I asked a farmer: What is the best fragrance that you know?
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Farmer:</strong> When the parched earth finally drinks the first drops of rain, a gentle fragrance rises from the soil—earthy, fresh, and full of hope. To me, that scent is the most beautiful in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked the same question to a labourer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Labourer:</strong> For me, the finest fragrance is the scent of sweat on my brow after a long day’s toil. It carries the dignity of hard work and the promise of a better tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p>
                I posed the same question to a patriotic poet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Patriotic Poet:</strong> The fragrance I cherish most is that of a soldier’s uniform—woven with courage, sacrifice, and love for the motherland.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then I asked a nature lover.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Nature Lover:</strong> To me, nothing compares to the sweet aroma of blooming flowers in spring—fresh, vibrant, and full of life’s renewal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each answer revealed a unique world shaped by experience and heart. The same question, yet so many beautiful perspectives. It reminds us that our views are colored by our journeys, beliefs, and dreams. To truly understand others, we must pause, listen, and embrace the richness of their perspectives before passing judgment.
