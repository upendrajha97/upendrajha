            <h2>The Perspective</h2>
            <p>
                Once I asked a farmer; Farmer, tell me, what is the best fragrance that you know?<br>
                Farmer answered me, that "when after a long time the dry land get sprinkled water, then a beautiful fragrance is found and that fragrance is the best fragrance".<br>
                I asked the same question to a labourer. He told me that "the drops of sweat on his forehead after working very hard create the best fragrance in the world".<br>
                A patriotic Poet answered the same question in the way that the "uniform of the soldiers has the best fragrance".<br>
                A nature loving Person says that "the growing sweet flowers in the spring have the best fragrance".<br>
                Everyone has their own opinion with their own perspective. The perspective of the same thing can vary with person to person according to their mindset, beliefs, situations that they face, and the acceptance of this variation is indispensable. The idea is to accept otherâ€™s point of view. Before judging someone, we need to introspect his perspective, why did he or she made that opinion.
